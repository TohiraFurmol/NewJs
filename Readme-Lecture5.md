## My review of Lecture 5 

**Object**

An object is actually a variable
Well, we defined a variable called Name and gave it the value of Sadegh, 
it is finished and gone. Now she says that an object is actually the same variable and is used to store data, 
only with the difference that this variable can have a characteristic or a characteristic with a value.

Create object : JavaScript object is a nonprimitive data-type that allows you to 
store multiple collections of data

We have 3 Methods object :
1.Object.entries()
2.Object. keys()
3.Object. values()

**Destructuring**

Destructuring AND spread in object :
The destructuring assignment syntax is a JavaScript expression that makes it 
possible to unpack properties from object, into distinct variables

How the this keyword works ,
The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used :
In an object , this refers to the object.
Alone , this refers to the glibal object.
In function , this refers to the glibal object.
In function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
. this is NOT a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.

**Data and Time**

DATA AND TIME :
In JavaScript, date and time are represented by the Date Object. The Date object
provides the date and time information and also provides various methods.
A JavaScript date defines the EcmaScript epoch that represents milliseconds
since 1 January 1970 UTC. This date and time is the same as the UNIX epoch
(predominant base value for computer-recorded date and time values).
Creating Date Objects
There are four ways to create a date object.
•new Date()
•new Date(milliseconds)
•new Date(Date string)
•new Date(year, month, day, hours, minutes, seconds,
milliseconds)


DATA AND TIME :
Now() :
Date. now returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970.

getFullYear() :
getFullYear0 returns the full year of a date (4 digits).

getMonth () :
getMonth() returns the month (O to 11) of the date. January
= 0, February =1,..

DATA AND TIME : 

get Date () :
The getDate() method returns the day of the month (1 to 31) of the date.

getDay () :
getFullYear0 returns the full year of a date (4 digits).

getHourse () : getMonth() returns the month (O to 11) of the date. January
= 0, February = 1,..
